## Why

A quick/pretty basic Docker cheat sheet

## Prerequisites

None.

## Installation

For the time being, I assume you have Docker installed and running. On my side, I'm currently playing with Scaleway.

## QuickStart

Start a container with an interactive shell
```
docker run --rm -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
```

** ````--rm```` : the container will be silently discarded when disconnecting

## Containers

````
some docker code
````

## Images

More infos about managing docker images 

## Misc

Misc infos. Keep away the usual mess.

## Todo

More stuff needs to be added here ! :-)
